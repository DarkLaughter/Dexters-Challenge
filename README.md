Welcome to Dexterâ€™s Challenge, inspired by Dexter's laboratory.

This app is built in React, using rating stars component and styled components
as part of my final project for the Software Flatiron

Data for questions is provided by the Open Trivia Database Api
https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

Backend for this app is built using a Rails api, with Postgres and active model serializers
https://github.com/DarkLaughter/Dexters-Challenge-rails-api

App contains 2 modes
Mandark's Quiz which is multiple choice and contains 10 questions with a 90 second time limit

Dee Dee's True or False, which are 5 true or false questions with a 90 second time limit.

A user is able to sign up or log in. Once logged in, users will be taken to their profile which will provide stats for all quizzes taken and ratings given to the quizzes.

Currently, this will be version 1 with updates and style changes coming for version 2 =)
